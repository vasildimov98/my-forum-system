## üëì Introduction

This project is designed for the final project defense of the ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni (June 2021). It is a forum system website and it's called **Tellit**.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Overview

**Tellit** is a place where users can browse posts, give their opinion on a post by like it or dislike it, or they can comment on it any time. Users can also create posts or categories. When a user creates a post he has to give it a title, content, and category. He can choose from the categories that are created or he can create a new one for himself. When a user creates a category he has to wait for approval from the administrator. When the category is approved, every user can now write a post or search for posts in this community.

To be able to read, write or comment on a post, or create a category, first users are required to create an account. Only an email and a password are needed for creating an account, after that, a user can edit its own profile by uploading a profile image or change their username, which is the email at first. Every user has their own page where they can look at their posts and approve categories. They can also edit or delete them if they want to.

Administrators are like every other user, except they have the right to edit and delete every post and category, and when they create a category they don't need to wait for the approval. Administrators also have Admin Panel to look at all the posts and categories and change or dismiss them.
