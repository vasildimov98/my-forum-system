‚úèÔ∏è ## Overview

**Tellit** is a place where users can browse posts, give their opion on a post by like it or dislike it, or they can comment on it any time. Users can also create posts or categories. When a user creates a post he has to give it a title, a content and a category. He can choice from the categories that are created or he can create a new one from himself. When a user creates a category he has to wait for its a approval from the administrator. When the category is a approve every user can now write a post or search for posts at this community.

To be able to read, write or comment on a post, or create a category, first users are required to create an account. Only an email and a password is needed for creating an account, after that a user can edit its own profile by uploading a profile image or chage its username, which is the email at first. Every users has its own page where they can look at their posts and approve cateogries. They can also edit or delete them if they want to.

Administrators are like every other users, except they have the right to edit, delete every posts and category, and when they create a cateogry they don't need to wait for approval. Administrator also have Admin Panel where they can look at all the posts and categories and change or dismissed them.
